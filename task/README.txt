Summary: This software simulates a simple banking system. The software uses the Luhn algorithm to generate unique 16 digit account numbers and to check for valid account numbers during the loggin process. 
Every generated account number is accompanied by a 4 digit PIN which also generated by the system. Users can use the account and PIN combination to log into their accounts to view their balance, add income 
to their balance, close (delete) their account, and transfer money to another existing account. User data such as account number, PIN, and balance amount is stored in a SQLite data base.
